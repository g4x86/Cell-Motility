# Cell Motility Simulation

This is the source code of the computational program that I developed in my doctoral research to simulate the isotropic spreading process of a fibroblast cell triggered by extracellular fibronectin.

## Introduction

The computational model built in this research work uses three actin filament biochemical reactions to drive the reorganization of actin cytoskeleton inside cell, push cell membrane outward, and cause cell to spread isotropically.

The pictures below show a schematic view of actin filament dynamics inside a cell and an early phase of a simulated cell spreading process:

## Compiling Code

Here are the steps to compile the source code.

## Running Simulation

Here are the steps to run the executable program and simulate an isotropic cell spreading process.
